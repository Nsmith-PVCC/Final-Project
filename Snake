# Snake Game 

A simple recreation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. This project was created as part of a programming final project to demonstrate knowledge of program design, the development cycle, and interactive gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- Classic Snake mechanics
- Score system
- Increasing speed as you score higher
- Basic graphical user interface using `pygame`

## Screenshot
*(Insert image here if you take one)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the game:
```bash
python snake_game.py
```

## Project Requirements

This game meets the following requirements:
- Demonstrates understanding of the development cycle
- Follows proper programming practices
- Uses interactive gameplay mechanics
- Includes a scoring system and increasing difficulty
- All code written by me with documented external resources

## Notes
> If I used any tutorials or external code snippets, I documented them with in-line comments and made sure I understood and modified them to fit my project.

## Instructor Note
This project was developed as part of a final project assignment and will be presented to demonstrate:
- The development cycle
- Code understanding and debugging process
- Program design and planning
